## üíª Code Overview: Heart Failure Prediction

This project builds a predictive model for heart failure using patient health data.

### Key Features of the Code:
- **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned and normalized the dataset to ensure high-quality inputs for machine learning models.
   - Conducted feature selection to focus on critical health metrics like age, ejection fraction, and serum sodium.

- **Model Training:**
   - Implemented multiple models, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
   - Hyperparameter tuning was applied for each model to achieve optimal performance using techniques like cross-validation.

- **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Created confusion matrices and ROC curves for performance visualization.

- **Feature Importance:**
   - Generated feature importance scores to identify key factors influencing heart failure predictions.
   - Major contributing factors include ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and patient age.

- **Prediction Pipeline:**
   - Built a robust pipeline for training and testing the heart failure prediction model.
   - Designed for scalability and integration with future patient data for ongoing predictions.
